Title: A Method for Assembling Two or more Gene Copies from Short Next-Generation Sequencing Reads
Version: 1.0
Author: Lei Yang
Maintainer: Lei Yang <leiyangslu@gmail.com>
Description: Assembles two or more gene copies from short Next-Generation Sequencing reads. Works best when there are only two gene copies. The read length should be 250bp or longer. High (e.g. >=10,000) and relatively even coverage are important because clustering analyses will be performed on the subsets of the read alignment. This methods works well for NGS-sequenced PCR amplicons.
